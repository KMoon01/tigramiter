# TIGRAMITER
This is a fork of TIGRAMITE. The original project is https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite.git

At this moment, it is just a personal experiment to make a more numerically usable version of the original TIGRAMITE, maybe by utilizing Numba and/or multi-proc/threading in key computations.
